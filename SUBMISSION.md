# PCI DSS Platform - Day 1 Infrastructure Submission

## ⏱️ Actual Time Spent

**Total: ~3 hours** (as requested)

**Breakdown:**

- Architecture design & threat modeling: 45 minutes
- Terraform implementation (VPC + EKS): 60 minutes  
- Security hardening & PCI compliance: 45 minutes
- Documentation & validation: 30 minutes

## 🎯 Assignment Requirements - Completed

### ✅ **README.md**

- **Mermaid diagram**: High-level architecture with PCI zones clearly marked
- **First 3 hardening steps**: Network isolation → Encryption → Audit logging
- **Rationale**: Each step justified with threat modeling perspective

### ✅ **Terraform Implementation**

- **Choice**: VPC + private EKS skeleton (option a)
- **Layout**: Clean modular structure, reusable components
- **Validation**: `terraform validate` passes
- **Runnable**: Ready for `terraform apply` with minimal configuration

### ✅ **Bonus Requirements Delivered**

- **Sidecar logging**: Vector → Loki configuration for payment service observability
- **PCI DSS zone design**: Comprehensive access control, secrets management, audit logging

## 🏗️ What Was Built

### Core Infrastructure (Day 1 Foundation)

```
VPC (10.0.0.0/16)
├── Private Subnets (Multi-AZ)
│   ├── PCI Node Group (m5.large, encrypted)  
│   └── General Node Group (t3.medium)
├── Public Subnets (NAT Gateway only)
└── Security Groups (restrictive rules)

EKS Cluster (v1.29+)  
├── Managed Node Groups (2 zones)
├── IRSA enabled (OIDC provider)
├── All logging enabled (5 types)
└── KMS encryption (secrets + EBS)

Security & Compliance
├── Customer-managed KMS keys
├── CloudTrail (all regions) 
├── CloudWatch (centralized logging)
└── IAM roles (least privilege)
```

### Generated Kubernetes Manifests

- **PCI Namespace**: Isolated workload environment with Pod Security Standards
- **Network Policies**: Default deny-all with explicit allow rules
- **Service Account**: IRSA-enabled for payment service authentication  
- **Resource Quotas**: Prevent resource exhaustion in PCI zone

## 🎯 Threat Modeling & Security Design

### Attack Vectors Addressed

1. **Lateral Movement Prevention**
   - Private subnets only (no direct internet access)
   - Security groups with minimal ports (443, 10250, 53)
   - Network policies for pod-to-pod isolation
   - Dedicated PCI node group separation

2. **Credential Compromise Mitigation**  
   - IRSA eliminates long-lived AWS credentials in pods
   - KMS encryption for all secrets and storage
   - Automatic key rotation (annual)
   - No hardcoded credentials anywhere

3. **Insider Threat & Privilege Escalation**
   - Kubernetes RBAC with minimal permissions
   - IAM roles follow least privilege principle
   - Audit logging for all actions (who, what, when)
   - Pod Security Standards enforce runtime restrictions

### Zero Trust Implementation

- **Network**: No trust between zones, explicit allow rules only
- **Identity**: Every component has unique, verifiable identity (IRSA)
- **Data**: Encrypted at rest and in transit with customer keys
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive audit trail for all activities

## 📋 What I'd Add Next

### Immediate Priority

1. **Enhanced Monitoring**
   - Prometheus operator for metrics collection
   - Grafana dashboards for payment service health
   - Alert manager for security incident response

2. **GitOps Pipeline**
   - ArgoCD for declarative deployment
   - Separate repos for platform vs applications
   - Policy-as-code with automated compliance checking

3. **Backup & Disaster Recovery**
   - Velero for cluster backup
   - Cross-region replication setup
   - RTO/RPO planning for payment services

## 🔍 Key Design Decisions & Trade-offs

### Public Modules vs Custom Code

**Decision**: Used terraform-aws-modules for VPC and EKS

- **Pro**: Battle-tested, community maintained, faster implementation
- **Con**: Less control, potential feature bloat
- **Mitigation**: Version pinning, selective feature enablement, security review

### Managed vs Self-Managed Node Groups

**Decision**: Managed node groups for Day 1

- **Pro**: AWS handles patching, scaling, lifecycle management
- **Con**: Less control over node configuration
- **Rationale**: Operational simplicity for platform team, can migrate later

### Customer-Managed vs AWS-Managed KMS

**Decision**: Customer-managed KMS keys

- **Pro**: Full control over encryption, compliance requirements
- **Con**: Additional management overhead
- **Rationale**: PCI DSS compliance often requires customer-controlled encryption

## 🛡️ PCI DSS Compliance Considerations

### Requirement Mapping

- **Req 1 (Firewalls)**: Security groups + NACLs + Network policies
- **Req 2 (Default passwords)**: No default credentials, IRSA authentication
- **Req 3 (Stored data protection)**: KMS encryption for all storage
- **Req 4 (Transmission encryption)**: TLS 1.2+ everywhere, private endpoints
- **Req 6 (Secure development)**: Managed nodes, automated patching
- **Req 7 (Access restriction)**: RBAC + IAM least privilege
- **Req 8 (Authentication)**: IRSA + OIDC integration
- **Req 10 (Logging)**: Comprehensive audit trail
- **Req 11 (Security testing)**: AWS Config rules, validation automation

### Evidence Generation

The infrastructure automatically generates compliance evidence:

- CloudTrail logs for access auditing
- AWS Config for configuration compliance
- CloudWatch metrics for security monitoring
- VPC Flow Logs for network traffic analysis

---

**Summary**: This submission delivers a production-ready, security-first foundation for KatanaPay's payment platform. The infrastructure follows zero trust principles, implements comprehensive PCI DSS controls, and provides a clean extensible architecture for future growth.

**Ready for**: Immediate deployment of the first payment microservice with confidence in the underlying security posture.
